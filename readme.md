# Audio Filters Automate

## Description

Audio Filters Automate is a powerful script designed to enhance and polish audio files by applying professional-grade filters. These filters are similar to the ones found in popular audio editing software like Audacity, allowing you to improve the quality and clarity of your audio recordings.

## How to Use

1. Prepare Your Audio Files:
   Place the audio files you want to process in the same folder as the script. Ensure your audio files are in a compatible format, such as MP3 or WAV.

2. Run the Script:
   Simply run the script, and it will automatically apply the following filters to your audio files:

   - Noise Reduction: Reduce or remove background noise from the audio, resulting in cleaner sound.
   - Hardlimiter: Limit the amplitude of the audio to prevent clipping or distortion, ensuring a smooth listening experience.
   - Equalizer: Adjust the frequency response of the audio to enhance or reduce specific frequencies, improving the overall audio balance.
   - Compression with Auto Normalizer LVS: Apply dynamic range compression to even out audio levels, and the auto normalizer brings the overall loudness to a desired level.

3. Optional: Silence Removal
   If desired, you can use the optional silence removal feature. This script will automatically remove silent spaces or pauses from the audio files, creating a seamless and uninterrupted audio playback.

## FFMPEG Dependency

The script relies on FFMPEG, a powerful multimedia framework, to perform the audio processing tasks. Before running the script, make sure you have FFMPEG installed on your system.
